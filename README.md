# Topological ML: Research in Topological Machine Learning and Graphical Representation Learning

This repo focuses on the topological machine learning research performed within the Topological ML Group, advancing graphical deep learning methods through persistent homology pipelines and vectorization techniques applied to complex datasets.

## Overview

The project builds and experiments with advanced topological data analysis (TDA) methods, specifically persistent homology, to extract shape and connectivity features from graphs and datasets. These methods are integrated with graphical representation learning on temporal graph data, with practical applications involving node and edge filtrations such as sublevel and superlevel filtrations. Cutting-edge graph descriptors including degree, centrality, Forman Ricci curvature, and Heat Kernel Signatures are utilized to enrich feature extraction.
